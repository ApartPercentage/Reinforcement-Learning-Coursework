    answer = "The gamma value is a discount factor used to balance the importance of immediate rewards versus future rewards. Q-learning estimates the action-value function that takes into account both the immediate reward and the expected future reward whereas First-Visit MC estimates the state-value function which only takes into account the expected future rewards. Thus, the average evaluation return of Q-learning is affected more by the gamma value."  # TYPE YOUR ANSWER HERE (100 words max)

    Based on your answer to question3_5(), briefly  explain why a decay strategy based on an exploration fraction

    strategy you implemented).

    answer = "Based on answer to q3.5, although 0.99 is approximately 1.0, the final epsilon value is different due to the fact that with epsilon_decay set to 1.0, the value of epsilon remains constant. The decay rate parameter in the exponential decay strategy is dependent on the specifics of the environment and may not be as adaptable to different environments. In contrast,the exploration fraction parameter is related to the progress of training rather than the specifics of the environment. The exploration factor allows the agent to explore the environment and gather information more."  # TYPE YOUR ANSWER HERE (100 words max)

    """
    answer = "DQN loss increases over time, mostly as a result of the non-stationarity (moving target) condition. This is unlike supervised learning approaches where the labels and data do not change. It becomes more difficult for the Q-network to approximate the new average return as the training goes on because the target network is updated and the average return rises by the sum of rewards. In other words, the agent is now choosing better actions, leading to a greater approximation error and more frequent higher value rewards."  # TYPE YOUR ANSWER HERE (150 words max)

    answer = "For tuning the hyperparameters, I used both grid search and random search for different hyperparameters. For hyperparameters such as batch size and the learning rate of the critic and policy network, I used grid search due to the fact that I already had some intuition about which values may be effective respectively. For the tau parameter, I used random search since the optimal value for tau may not be evenly distributed across the hyperparameter space. As for the hidden size of the critic and policy network, I first used grid search on [64, 64], [128,128], and [256,256] before using random search to search an optimal hidden size of the network between [256,256] to [512, 512]."  # TYPE YOUR ANSWER HERE (200 words max)
